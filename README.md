# LSTM-Based-Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Hospital-Bed-Occupancy-Prediction

Developing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict hospital bed occupancy across different wards for a given date or month. This project leverages historical admission and occupancy data to forecast future demand, aiding in efficient resource allocation and hospital management. The model aims to improve patient care by optimizing bed utilization and reducing overcrowding. Techniques such as data preprocessing, time series feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance prediction accuracy.

Special thanks to Mr. Kanishk Garg for his significant contributions and support in this project.
